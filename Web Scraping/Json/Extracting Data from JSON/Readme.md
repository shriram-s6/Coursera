Extracting Data from JSON

In this assignment you will write a Python program that will prompt for a URL, read the JSON data from that URL using urllib/requests 
and then parse and extract the comment counts from the JSON data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file and enter the sum below:
We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing 
and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json (Sum=2553)
Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_1269059.json (Sum ends with 43)
