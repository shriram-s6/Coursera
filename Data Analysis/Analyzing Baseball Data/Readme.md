Data analysis on Baseball data that spans the years 1871-2016.

Project Description:

The first project in this course required you to develop code for reading and writing CSV files using dictionaries. 
For this project, we will provide you with a several CSV files that contain data on the performance of Major League Baseball (MLB) player over a span of more than a century.  
You will build upon the work you did in the previous project to statistically analyze this data. This historical baseball data can be found at seanlehman.com in his baseball archive. 
The archive includes the raw data (stored in CSV files) used in computing most important baseball statistics.
